This is a Chip8 emulator built in C++ using SDL2. The project was developed as a learning experience to understand the basics of old CPUs and emulation. The Chip8 is a virtual machine from the 1970s, making it an excellent introduction to low-level programming concepts, CPU instruction sets, and memory management.

Features
Supports loading and running .ch8 ROM files.
Implements CPU cycles, timers, and keypad handling.
Simple monochrome display (64x32 pixels).
Usage
Place .ch8 ROM files in the project directory.
Modify the romFilename in main.cpp or enter a ROM filename at runtime.
